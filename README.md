# Case Study: Cyclistic Bike-Share
## Introduction
For my google analytics capstone project I decided to look a a case study that uses ride-share data to solve a business task and make suggestions to marketing. This project explores data analysis by going through the steps of the analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,** and **act**. 
## Scenario 
You  are  a  junior  data  analyst  working  in  the  marketing  analyst  team  at  Cyclistic,  a  bike-share  company  in  Chicago.  The  director of  marketing  believes  the  companyâ€™s  future  success  depends  on  maximizing  the  number  of  annual  memberships.  Therefore, your  team  wants  to  understand  how  casual  riders  and  annual  members  use  Cyclistic  bikes  differently.  From  these  insights, your  team  will  design  a  new  marketing  strategy  to  convert  casual  riders  into  annual  members.  But  first,  Cyclistic  executives must  approve  your  recommendations,  so  they  must  be  backed  up  with  compelling  data  insights  and  professional  data visualizations.
## Ask 
Asking the right question is essential to making sure your project runs smoothly. The question that we are looking to answer is called the **Business Task**, which is question or problem that data analysis resolves for a business. There are 5 different features you should look for in a question:

1. Is the question specific?
2. Will the question give you answers that you can measure?
3. Will the answers inform decision making and action?
4. Is the question relevant to the problem you are trying to solve?
5. Are the answers relevant to the specific time being studied?

The question that we are looking to answer is **How do annual member and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?** By answering this question, we can help stakeholders take action to increase annual membership among casual riders.

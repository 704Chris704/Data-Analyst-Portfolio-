## About
I put this portfolio together To showcase what I've learned about Data Analysis programming languages. I graduated from
West Chester Univeristy in May 2023 with a Bachelors degree in Economics. While I was in school I learned some of the basics
of R and Python for Data Analysis along with classes in Accounting, Statistics, and Finance. I've taken classes that taught me 
the basics of using Python and R for data analysis. Since I've graduated, I've taken online courses and recieved the Gogle Data Analyitics
Certificate to hone my knowlege of things like SQL, R, Excel, and Tableau. If you are interested in reaching out you can contact me on LinkedIn.

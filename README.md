## About
Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Christian Johnson, and I've put together this collection to showcase my passion for data analysis and programming languages.
I graduated from West Chester University in May 2023 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in economics. During my time at university, I delved into various aspects of data analysis, including coursework in Accounting, Statistics, and Finance. It was here that I first discovered my interest in utilizing programming languages like R and Python for data analysis purposes.
Since graduating, I've been committed to furthering my skills and knowledge in the field. I've completed several online courses, including the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, where I gained expertise in SQL, R, Excel, and Tableau. These courses have allowed me to deepen my understanding of data analysis techniques and tools, enabling me to tackle complex analytical problems.
If you'd like to connect or learn more about my background and experiences, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-johnson-7872b51a1/). I'm always excited to engage with people and explore potential opportunities or discussion.
Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
